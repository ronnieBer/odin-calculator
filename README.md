# PROJECT: CALCULATOR

### A Brief Introduction
In this fifth and last repository from The Odin Project Foundations Course: JavaScript Basic, I will build an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Learning Goal
- To combine everything I've learned so far in the Foundations Course.

## Reflection/Outcome
After I finished the basic setup of a calculator in HTML and CSS, I decided to use JavaScript Object for the calculator to flex what I learned in The Odin Project Foundations Course: JavaScript Basic - Fundamental Part 5.
